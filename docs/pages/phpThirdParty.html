    <h1>Submitting your data through a third party.</h1>

    This step is only recommended if your preferred web host doesn't support PHP. Otherwise, use
    the <a href="phpForm.html">php tutorials</a> to get better control of your experiment, as well as
    more data from the user (there is also a concern that a third party service will inject some
    instability in your experiment by change its pricing plans, or quietly going out of business).
    <br><br><br><br>
    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="javaScriptAjax.html">Completed all of the page creation tutorials</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for HTML and JavaScript (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
        <li>A third party form manager (<a href="https://formsubmit.co/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    (as of June 2020)

    <br><br>
    <h2>You will learn:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How to set up your page to work with a third party form manager.</li>
    </ol>

    <br><br>
    Because you are using a third party server to handle your data, you can do very little
    server side validation. Therefore you should never auto pay your participants on
    completion.
    <br><br>
    You may come across tutorials which hack up a google form for use in their experiment, don't.
    To the best of my knowledge google has changed the layout of their forms in a way which makes
    this more difficult, and even if you work around it, they can change the names of their inputs
    which could lose data, as well as require you to completely rename everything in your experiment.

    <br><br>
    For these code heavy tutorials, it is recommended to full screen the video and watch at 720p

    Note:
    <ol>
        <li>Because the <q>ajax</q> solution was so simple, it is not included in the above files.</li>
        <li>In case it isn't clear, the <q>fake</q> ajax we try in the later portions of the tutorial
            can't guarentee data was processed. We are only guessing that data was submitted.</li>
