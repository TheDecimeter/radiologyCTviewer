    This step is only recommended if your preferred web host doesn't support PHP. Otherwise, use
    the <a href="phpForm.html">php tutorials</a> to get better control of your experiment, as well as
    more data from the user (there is also a concern that a third party service will inject some
    instability in your experiment by change its pricing plans, or quietly going out of business).
    <br><br><br><br>
    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="javaScriptAjax.html">Completed all of the page creation tutorials</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for HTML and JavaScript (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
        <li>A third party form manager (<a href="https://formsubmit.co/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    (as of June 2020)

    <br><br>
    <h2>You will learn:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How to set up your page to work with a third party form manager.</li>
    </ol>

    <br><br>
    Because you are using a third party server to handle your data, you can do very little
    server side validation. Therefore you should never auto pay your participants on
    completion.
