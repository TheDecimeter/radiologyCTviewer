    <h1>Remove unnecessary files.</h1>

    <a href="contents.html">Back to Contents</a>
    <br><br><br><br>
    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="viewerStart.html">A working build of the viewer</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for HTML, JavaScript and PHP (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    (as of June 2020)

    <br><br><br><br>
    You will be deleting files, so it is recommended that you make a copy before continuing.
    <br><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove any debug buttons from the viewer page (like that button on the first one or two pages).</li>
        <li>Delete any files you aren't using.
            <ul>
                <li>Viewer Version (viewer.php, viewerOnly.html)</li>
                <li>the readme</li>
                <li>custom.js if it is unused</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Set <q>quickKeys</q> and <q>fakeGPU</q> in the debug section of assets/config.ini to false.</li>
        <li>Check slidedim.txt. Make sure no lines have a file number (second number) which isn't their own index number (first number) if that
            index number isn't used. If that happens, set the file number to match the index number and rename the file in the slides folder.</li>
        <li>Delete any slide files you aren't using from the slides folder</li>
        <li>Edit assets.txt
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the slide files you just deleted from assets.txt</li>
                <li>Check the file sizes of slidedim.txt, shapes.txt, and config.ini, make sure these
                    are accurate in assets.txt</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you ever set the forms to not reset, make sure they reset again (the tutorials never
            directed you to remove resetting, so you would know if you need to reenable this.</li>
        <li>Run the ct viewer
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure nothing important was deleted.</li>
                <li>Keep the console open, are all the console messages you print out still necessary.</li>
                <li>Would you like to have more messages at key events where something could go wrong when you
                    ask the lab to run tests on the viewer (so that you can get better feedback from them).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You may wish to remove index.html, or make it a dead page with no link to your trial.
            <ul>
                <li>You will be distributing the trial with a link directly to it, the homepage is unneeded.
                and might be an easier way for people (who may give you meaningless data) to find your experiment.</li>
                <li>Be aware that this might be against some host's terms and conditions
                    (Some free hosts worry about becoming file servers, so web pages are required to be linked together).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When you are happy with how everything is running, clean out your data folders.</li>
    </ol>


    <br><br><br><br>
    I would recommend adding credits to the end of your debrief (or somewhere).
    <br><br>
    Give attribution to whoever you got your images from. I know <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/licence?lang=us">radiopedia</a>
    likes attribution if you got images from them. Obviously when you conduct studies in the privacy of your own labs,
    credit doesn't matter. However, if you put something on the Internet, anyone can see it. Some people
    might want to know where to get the source images for themselves and some might simply want credit for
    sharing the original image. Even if someone says you don't have to credit them, I recommend doing it anyway.
    It is possible that someone sold you an image to use which was always free from another source.
    When you credit them, you have a chance of exposing their fraud.

    This viewer is powered by the LibGDX graphics engine. They're <a href="https://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=13531">super easy going</a> about getting credit,
    but it would still be nice. Normally I include this to the HTML:
    <div style="margin-left:1em; margin-top:1em;background-color:#AAF4;padding:1em;border-radius:1em;">
    <code>
        Powered by libGDX (&lt;a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/&lt;/a>)&lt;br><br>

    </code>
    </div>
    <br>
    Which looks like:
    <div style="margin-left:1em; margin-top:1em;background-color:#FFF4;padding:1em;border-radius:1em;">

    If you want to credit me (and there's no legal reason to do so), something like this could work:
    <div style="margin-left:1em; margin-top:1em;background-color:#AAF4;padding:1em;border-radius:1em;">
