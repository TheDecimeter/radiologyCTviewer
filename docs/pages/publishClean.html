    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="viewerStart.html">A working build of the viewer</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for HTML, JavaScript and PHP (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    I would recommend adding credits to the end of your debrief (or somewhere).
    <br><br>
    Give attribution to whoever you got your images from. I know <a href="https://radiopaedia.org/licence?lang=us">radiopedia</a>
    likes attribution if you got images from them. Obviously when you conduct studies in the privacy of your own labs,
    credit doesn't matter. However, if you put something on the Internet, anyone can see it. Some people
    might want to know where to get the source images for themselves and some might simply want credit for
    sharing the original image. Even if someone says you don't have to credit them, I recommend doing it anyway.
    It is possible that someone sold you an image to use which was always free from another source.
    When you credit them, you have a chance of exposing their fraud.

    This viewer is powered by the LibGDX game engine. They're <a href="https://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=13531">super easy going</a> about getting credit,
    but it would still be nice. Normally I include this to the HTML:
    <div style="margin-left:1em; margin-top:1em;background-color:#AAF4;padding:1em;border-radius:1em;">
    <c>

    </c>
    </div>
    <br>
    Which looks like:
    <div style="margin-left:1em; margin-top:1em;background-color:#FFF4;padding:1em;border-radius:1em;">

    If you want to credit me (and there's no legal reason to do so), something like this could work:
    <div style="margin-left:1em; margin-top:1em;background-color:#AAF4;padding:1em;border-radius:1em;">
