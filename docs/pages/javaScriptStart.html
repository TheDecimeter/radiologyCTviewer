    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="viewerStart.html">A working build of the viewer</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for HTML, JavaScript and PHP (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>You will learn:</h2>

        <li>How to make navigable pages.</li>
        <li>How to make the viewer show a particular image</li>
        <li>How to make a simple branch in pages</li>
    </ol>

    <br><br>
    This part is fairly universal, however the upcomming portions will require you to make a choice about how you want your data.
    <br>
    The recommended way is to find your own host with php to process your own data, this reduces your dependency on other
    services, while simultaneously providing you with the greatest flexibility.
    <br>
    If, however, you wish to integrate another form service into your experiment, that is also generally possible but more difficult because
    you are using a service in a way it wasn't designed. For an example of what this is like, here is an example
    of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAkESLyXO74">simple form which interfaces with Google Forms</a>. However,
    if you want to go with a third party, I recommend a service designed to be integrated with custom web pages (eg formspree).
