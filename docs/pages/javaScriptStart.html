    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="viewerStart.html">A working build of the viewer</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for HTML, JavaScript and PHP (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    (as of June 2020)

    <br><br>
    <h2>You will learn:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How to make navigable pages.</li>
        <li>How to make the viewer show a particular image</li>
        <li>How to make a simple branch in pages</li>
    </ol>

    <br><br>
    This part is fairly universal, however the upcomming portions will require you to make a choice about how you want your data.
    <br>
    The recommended way is to find your own host with php to process your data, this reduces your dependency on other
    services, while simultaneously providing you with the greatest flexibility.
    <br>
    If, however, you wish to integrate another form service (like formspree) into your experiment that is possible, but not
    covered here because these services aren't free. Be aware that there are tutorials for integrating Google Forms, however
    I don't recommend this, Google Forms wasn't designed to be used outside of their framework and they can change things at
    any time which will break your entire setup (as it is, I think they already changed things which make current tutorials
    less usable).

    <br><br>
    Be aware that two changes aren't refelected in the files:
    <ol>
        <li>I rename file03.jpg in the assets/slides folder to file02.jpg.</li>
        <li>I rename viewerBlank.html to v.html</li>
    </ol>
