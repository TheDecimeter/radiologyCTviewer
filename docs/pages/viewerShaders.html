                        <li>Logging Tips:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Creation of custom shaders log the entire shader code, it is recommended to not log these events, and log a message stating the shader's creation instead.
                                    This will require less data to be passed back to the server and make your logs cleaner.
                                </li>
                                <li>Custom shaders are made of code with contain commas, semi-colons, and new lines. Because these would be common choices for separators, you will have
                                    to become more creative. Remember that separators can be many characters long: <code>viewerGetShaderLog('2222222','5555555555')</code> is perfectly legal.
                                    Not the most legable, but if you're autoparsing and need to return custom shaders in your log, you probably already gave up on legablity.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The following functions all have the optional parameter <code>log</code>, if this is false, the change will not be logged, otherwise
                            shader changes are logged by default.</li>
                        <li>If you create an image windowed from -1000HU to 1000HU as recommended, any window with a high value over 1000 will not be <q>accurate</q>
                            because values > 1000 are now = 1000. Normally this missing data will go unnoticed, but you should be aware of this.</li>
                        <li>If a shader is added with the same <code>name</code> as a previous shader, the previous shader is overwritten. If that shader was currently
                            active, the new shader will become active.<br><br><br></li>

    <br><br>
    <h2 id="advanced"><b>Advanced Windowing</b></h2>
    For easy transmission of images over the Internet as well as a uniformly smooth runtime experience, this viewer requires images which have 8 bits per color.
    Dicoms, on the other hand, often store 12 bits per color allowing them to show a much greater change in contrast. Because these
    images are grayscale, where all colors are equal, we can store half of the bits in one color, and half
    in another. The supplied way of doing this for the viewer is to store the top half of the bits as red, and
    the bottom half as green (blue is unused).

    Unfortunately, this means the images will have to be stored losslessly (as a png), and will be harder
    to compress generally (about twice the size of a normal, grayscale, png). Because of this, it is recommended that
    high bit depths are only used for internal testing, and never in practice.
    <br><br>
    If you do need a higher bit depth, it is recommended that you use a viewer designed for that,
    spread your <q>windows</q> across multiple images, or
    possibly make your own glsl shader which works better with jpeg's compression.
    <br><br>
    The 8 bit windowing shaders which come with the viewer expect the source image to be rendered with a window preapplied.
    This can either be from <a href="#viewerAddWindowingShaderGray">-1000 to 1000</a>, or from <a href="#viewerAddWindowingShaderGrayFull">-1000 to 3095</a>.
    <br><br>
    However there if you need to render your source images with a different window this is fine. The <a href="#zeroedWindow"><q>Zeroed</q> window shaders</a>
    can handle this, but you do have to offset your values to mimmic HU.

    These are roughly the steps to go through to make high bit images to work in the the included
    16 bit shader. This is loose guidance only, it is expected that if you go this route, you have your own means of
    creating high bit depth images, so some of these steps will differ from your own.
    <br><br><br>
    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="viewerStart.html">A working build of the viewer</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for bash and python (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
        <li>A means of converting dicoms into the correct sequence of images. The software used in the example:
            <ul>
                <li>Linux/Bash - calls the converter on each image, and turns the meta data into a useful, ordered, file name</li>
                <li><a href="https://xmedcon.sourceforge.io/">XMedCon</a> - reads image metadata to get spatial location for ordering and converts dicom to ascii</li>
                <li>Python - simple script to read values stored in ascii file and turn them into an image</li>
                <li><a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">Image Magick</a> - to turn the final pngs into a grid of images</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> - Not needed in the example, but sometimes nice for error correction</li>
                <li><a href="files/dcm2png.zip">My Scripts</a> - Output dicoms to ascii files and then to various png formats</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br><br><br>



    <br><br>
    <h2 id="lostData"><b>The Lost Information</b></h2>
    <br>
    These two images both use a window where level is 0 and width is 2000. Which one is correct?<br>
    <img src="images/noIntercept.png" alt="ct image slice, slightly brighter">
    <img src="images/withIntercept.png" alt="ct image slice, slightly darker">
    <br>
    I'm pretty sure it's the second one. Dicoms typically store 24 values that are less dense then air.
    I think that means the proper way to render them is by making all of these values black.
    So the "full" window expects these values to blend together (even in the "lossless" 16 bit
    version). If you want to keep this data around, you can either set your window to start 24 values below
    air or ignore the <q>intercept</q>value in the dicom file, but this will result in a slightly brighter image (the first one).
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <img style="width:100%;" src="images/windowingLoss.jpg" alt="bars showing the difference in size between 256, 2000, and 4096">
    <br>
    As mentioned in the advanced windowing section, the ct viewer stores its data in common image formats.
    So the available data in the 4096 value (dicom) format is heavily reduced to fit in only 256 values (png/jpg).
    <br><br>
    In any experiments without windoing, this isn't really an issue. The dicom is often shown in only 256 shades
    of gray because of the monitor and/or graphics card.<br>
    When a window is applied in a normal dicom viewer, there is usually plenty of range in values to fill the available
    256. It is often safe to say that the value range used in an window are the smaller of either the window width, and the color
    depth of your monitor (usually 256). Two examples where 256 values aren't achieved: the liver window above is too narrow to show 256 values,
    and the lung window,
    which is huge and easily encompasses 256 available values, has to have a lower color depth because it stretches below the available data
    (this is why lung windows don't show pure blacks).
    <br><br>
    Notice that the 2000 wide window I suggest doesn't cover the entire range of a dicom image. This means any windows
    which go over 1000 HU will not be correct (I doubt anyone will notice though). This is mostly the Bone and
    Full Dynamic Windows. In these cases the values under 1000 will be the expected shade, however some values at 1000 will be
    dimmer than in a dicom viewer, and there will be no pure whites (while Full Dynamic is supposed to guarentee pure
    whites). This is because the 2000 wide window drops everything above 1000  to 1000. So if the bone window topped out
    at 1300, there will no longer be any values which meet this threshold.
    <br><br>

    <img style="width:48%;" src="images/hist8f.jpg" alt="ct slice with very wide jagged histogram">
    <img style="width:48%;" src="images/hist8z.jpg" alt="ct slice with wide jagged histogram">

    <img style="width:48%;" src="images/hist16.jpg" alt="ct slice with smooth histogram with 5 missing values">
    <br>
    All of these images have the same abdomen window applied. Going Clockwise from top left:
    <q>Full</q> 4096 wide 8 bit png, <q>Zeroed</q> 2000 wide 8 bit png, Full 16 bit png, Original dicom rendered
    with Amide (Not displayed in this online ct viewer.

    <br><br>
    Notice the holes in the histogram in the bottom 2 images. We used a window that was 250 HU wide,
    so 5 values are missing (the last image has the missing values lining up really well with GIMP's unit
    markings).
    <br><br>
    A few things to note:
    <ul class="li1">
        <li class="li2">The missing values in my 16 bit image aren't the same as the values in the real dicom viewer (and the
            histograms are slightly different for what would be expected in a "lossless" conversion).
            <ul>
                <li>I think this is due to a scaling factor I apply to keep all my window values consistant,
                this makes numbers round off slightly differently. Otherwise, I think the data is the same (but
                unfortunately can't say for sure).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="li2">The images all look incredibly similar despite ranging from 17 to 251 values.
            <ul>
                <li>I was surprised by this too, maybe marketing departments are lying to us when it
                    comes to needing higher color definition :)</li>
                <li>Really the biggest constraint when it comes to the narrowness of your window is how
                    heavily you apply jpg's compression. This should definitly be varried according to
                    what window widths you offer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="li2">Some of the images are slightly brighter even though the window is the same.
            <ul>
                <li>This depends on the width of the holes in the histogram.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a hole is wide, there is a larger range a window's level can be moved
                            without the window changing.</li>
                        <li>This means a window can be at the edge of this <q>range</q> which
                            will cause it to be brighter or darker.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Generally, this will never be noticed because the brightness of images
                varies wildly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    If you take a closer look at any of these images, please be aware of the zoom level of the straight dicom
    image. It was rendered smaller, so I had to scale it up slightly to match the others in GIMP which
    gives it a hint of antialiasing.
