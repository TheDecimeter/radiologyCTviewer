                        <li>Logging Tips:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Creation of custom shaders log the entire shader code, it is recommended to not log these events, and log a message stating the shader's creation instead.
                                    This will require less data to be passed back to the server and make your logs cleaner.
                                </li>
                                <li>Custom shaders are made of code with contain commas, semi-colons, and new lines. Because these would be common choices for separators, you will have
                                    to become more creative. Remember that separators can be many characters long: <c>viewerGetShaderLog('2222222','5555555555')</c> is perfectly legal.
                                    Not the most legable, but if you're autoparsing and need to return custom shaders in your log, you probably already gave up on legablity.

                <li>Notes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The following functions all have the optional parameter <c>log</c>, if this is false, the change will not be logged, otherwise
                            shader changes are logged by default.</li>
                        <li>If you create an image windowed from -1000HU to 1000HU as recommended, any window with a high value over 1000 will not be <q>accurate</q>
                            because values > 1000 are now = 1000. Normally this missing data will go unnoticed, but you should be aware of this.</li>
                        <li>If a shader is added with the same <c>name</c> as a previous shader, the previous shader is overwritten. If that shader was currently
                            active, the new shader will become active.<br><br><br></li>

                <li>Custom Shader Creation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Custom shaders are written in the WebGL varient of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">glsl</a></li>
                        <li>When referring to the pixel components in glsl, the values range from 0 to 1, not 0 to 255</li>
                        <ul>
                        <li id="viewerAddCustomShader"><c>viewerAddCustomShader( name, vertexShader, fragmentShader, <i>optional</i> log )</c>: Add a shader named <c>name</c> with the shader components defined
                            as strings. You can set the <c>vertexShader</c> to <q>d</q> if you want to use a simple default vertex shader. However you always have to
                            specify the <c>fragmentShader</c>. <a href="#returnSuccess" onclick="H('returnSuccess');"><sup>1</sup></a></li>

                <li>8 bit <q>Zeroed</q> Window Shader Creation (Recommended for CT images):

                        <li><b>It is <u>strongly</u> recommended that, for windowing purposes, you use only the default shaders.</b></li>
                        <li>These shaders expect source images rendered at 8 bits per color with level at 0HU and width at 2000HU</li>
                        <li>This seems to be common in CT viewers. Applying windows with the following functions appear to match
                            the output of Microdicom (the viewer I used to check my output against)</li>
                        <li>If you don't know your bits per color, but are outputing dicoms to png or jpg, it's safe to assume they are 8 bit.</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li id="viewerAddWindowingShaderGray"><c>viewerAddWindowingShaderGray( name, level, width, <i>optional</i> log )</c>: Create a windowing shader named <c>name</c> with the specified

                        red = green = blue. If this is not the case, use value shading below (obviously you don't have to check every pixel, it won't break anything if this is
                        off a little, CT images are grayscale).<a href="#windowingUnits" onclick="H('windowingUnits');">*</a> <a href="#returnSuccess" onclick="H('returnSuccess');"><sup>1</sup></a></li>

                <li>8 bit Full Depth Window Width Shader Creation:
                    <ul>
                        <li>These shaders expect source images rendered with level at 1048HU and width at 4096HU (full 12 bit range)</li>
                        <li>Dicoms tend to store data in 12 or 16 bits. This shader works with that range, but reduces
                            the depth to 8 bits (so data is lost, but these images still work like regular images).</li>
                        <li>Normally human bodies don't need to show any variety above 1000HU so it is generally advised
                            to prepare your source images to work with the default shaders above.</li>
                        <li>Because the usual contrast is roughly halved, the pixel values are expanded in these shaders to match
                            the look of the default shader.</li>
                        <li>If you don't know your bits per color, but are outputing dicoms to png or jpg, it's safe to assume they are 8 bit.</li>

                            I am only including it as a means to test contrast correctness for different windowing levels.
                            If your trials need higher color depth, this viewer is probably not the right choice for you.
                            If you don't know whether or not you need higher color depth, you don't.</li>
                        <li>This shader expects images rendered as pngs with the highest 8 bits stored in the red component, and the lowest
                            8 bits stored in the green.</li>
                        <li>This shader combines 8 bits from the red and green components at runtime to show a 16 bit grayscale image.</li>
                        <li>Because this contrast is 16 times higher, the pixel values are reduced in this shader to match
                            the look of the default shader (the high contrast is still there, but it will never be noticable unless very
                            narrow windows are used.</li>

    <h2 id="advanced"><b>Advanced Shader Control</b></h2>
    This viewer offloads windowing to the GPU for speed. This requires images which have 8 bits per color.
    Dicoms, on the other hand, often store 12 bits per color allowing them to show a much greater change in contrast. Because these
    images are grayscale, where all colors are equal, we can store half of the bits in one color, and half
    in another. The default way of doing this for the viewer is to store the top half of the bits as red, and
    the bottom half as green (blue is unused).
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately, this means the images will have to be stored losslessly (as a png), and will be harder
    to compress generally (about twice the size of a normal, grayscale, png). Because of this, it is recommended that
    high bit depths are only used for internal testing, and never in practice.

    If you do need a higher bit depth, it is recommended that you use a viewer designed for that, or
    possibly make your own glsl shader which works better with jpeg's compression.
    <br><br>
    These are roughly the steps to go through to make high bit images to work in the the included
    16 bit shader. This is loose guidance only, it is expected that if you go this route, you have your own means of
    creating high bit depth images, so some of these steps will differ from your own.
    <br><br><br>
    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="viewerStart.html">A working build of the viewer</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for bash and python (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
        <li>A means of converting dicoms into the correct sequence of images. The software used in the example:
            <ul>
                <li>Linux/XFCE/Thunar - because bash is used, also has a nice batch renaiming feature</li>
                <li>Bash - calls the converter on each image, and turns the meta data into a useful, ordered, file name</li>
                <li><a href="https://xmedcon.sourceforge.io/">XMedCon</a> - reads image metadata to get spatial location for ordering and converts dicom to ascii</li>
                <li>Python - simple script to read values stored in ascii file and turn them into an image</li>
                <li><a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">Image Magick</a> - to turn the final pngs into a grid of images</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> - Not needed in the example, but sometimes nice for error correction</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
