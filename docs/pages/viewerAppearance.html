            <h2><b>Convert the slices to a common image format</b></h2>

            I mostly assume you have a way of doing this already. However, there may be 2 steps which differ from what you are used to:
            <br>
            <ul class="li2">
                <li>If you intend on using windowing, export the image with the spectrum: HU level: 0, width 2000.</li>
                <li>Try to export the image into something lossless like PNG because you will have to <a href="#tileImage">tile them</a> later.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            If you don't have a pipeline for converting dicoms to png, here are 2 free ways:

            <h3>Windows Tutorial Video:</h3>
            Be aware the the gimp solution in this video is very slow, if you have a large slice count (depends on your computer, but probably greater than 150), set this to run overnight.

            Steps:
            <ul class="li1">
                <li class="li2">First, know that the end products should be as square as possible eg:
                    <ul>
                        <li>7 x 7 if there are between 43 - 49 slices </li>
                        <li>7 x 8 if there are between 50 - 56 slices </li>
                        <li>8 x 8 if there are between 57 - 64 slices </li>
                        <li>etc.</li>
                        <li>It doesn't have to be perfect, but load time is shortened if we can chunk the whole image
                             into the GPU and square collages will help with that.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="li2">Software for combining images:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Option 1: Imagemagick
                            <ol>
                                <li>Install Imagemagick (on Ubuntu, just <code>$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick</code>), other platforms might require you to build this from scratch.</li>
                                <li>Go to the folder with your pngs</li>
                                <li>Open a terminal there and run: <code>$ montage -mode concatenate -tile 8x *.png out.png</code>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The <q><code>8x</code></q> means: Tile the new image <q>8 by whatever</q>, so the second dimension will be whatever it needs to be
                                            to fit all of the slices. Change the 8 to be the floor of the square root of your image count.
                                            <br>Input Total Slices:
                                            <input type="number" id="flrSqtIn1" oninput="flrSqt(1);"> <code><span id="flrSqtOut1">8</span>x</code>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Note that for even slightly thin slices you will have to <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/resources.php">
                                    increase the memory Imagemagick allows itself in <q>policy.xml</q></a>. On Ubuntu, this file is found at /etc/imagemagick-6/policy.xml

                </li>

                <li class="li2">Again, this might not be the final image, so lossless formats (like PNG) are preferred.</li>

            <br><br>
            <h2><b>Final compression</b></h2>
            Again, the process depends on your image editing program.
            <ul class="li2">
               <li>Load the complete collage into an editor (if you went the Gimp route above, you are already here)</li>
                <li>You can usually save a little space by makeing sure the image mode is in grayscale.
                <ul>
                    In Gimp, go to Image > Mode > Grayscale
                </ul>
                </li>
               <li>Typically each slice in my images are 512 x 512 (so the full 8 x 8 example would be 4096 x 4096)</li>
               <li>Scale the image to whatever you want, but make sure the final resolution is evenly divisible by the tile resolution
                   <ul>
                       <li>For example, 4096 / 8 = 512 exactly.</li>
                       <li>If a dimension wasn't evenly divisible (eg 4095 / 8 = 511.875) the viewer will round off a pixel and the image will migrate
                           slightly as it is scrolled.
                       </li>
                       <li>Before you scale the image, make sure empty portions of the image are a color similar to your slice's background
                           <ul>
                               <li>Imagemagick makes the empty parts white, when you scale the image the smoothing algorithm will blend this
                                   white into neighboring slices (creating a white border along the bottom of some slices).
                               </li>
                           </ul>
                       </li>
                   </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Export the image. This is hopefully the final product and you will typically want to use lossy compression. (JPG).
                   <ul>
                       <li>Because these images are low on color you can typically get away with a lot of compression.</li>
                       <li>If you are using windowing with very narrow widths you will want less compression.</li>
                   </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>

            Steps:
            <ul class="li2">
               <li>Let's replace the simple trial's image with yours</li>
               <li>Go to the build01 folder where you have your <q>index.html</q></li>
               <li>Go to the <q>assets</q> folder and change 3 things:
                   <ol>
                        <li>Edit <q>assets.txt</q>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Find the size of your new image in bytes, let's pretend it was 1,234,756 bytes large.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Maybe right clicking will tell you, otherwise, search the Internet for how.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Open <q>assets.txt</q> and find a line that looks like <q>i:slides/file01.jpg:1489715:image/jpeg</q></li>
                                <li>This line contains the file name, size, and mime type (separated by colons):
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If your image is a .jpg, you only have to change its file size, so the new line is: <q>i:slides/file01.jpg:1234567:image/jpeg</q></li>
                                        <li>If your image is a .png, the new line is: <q>i:slides/file01.png:1234567:image/png</q></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Edit <q>slidedim.txt</q>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Open <q>slidedim.txt</q></li>
                                <li>This file tells the viewer how to parse your image, more at <a href="viewerConfig.html#slideDim">Viewer Configuration</a>.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The first number is the index for the set of slides (think: a specific trial), no other rows can have this same index. This stays <q>1</q></li>
                                        <li>The next number is the file number, we used <q>file01</q> in <q>assets.txt</q> so we'll keep this <q>1</q>. Trials can use the same file if
                                            desired, this decreases download and image processing time (currently the reward <q>trial</q> is at index 4, and uses the same image as trial 3.
                                            This gives us a separate place to use click states for the fireworks, while leaving the user's clicks untouched).</li>
                                        <li>The next number is the width, in slides, our image is, let's say this was <q>8</q>, so change this number.</li>
                                        <li>The next number is the height, in slides, our image is, let's say this was <q>7</q>, so change this number.</li>
                                        <li>The next number is the total slides, our image is, let's say this was <q>53</q>, so change this number (Note this would mean we would have some
                                            empty spaces in our image since 7*8 is 56, this is fine though, make sure to enter the actual number of slides <q>53</q>, and NOT total
                                            possible slices <q>56</q>).</li>
                                        <li>The next item is a boolean value indicating whether you wish to record clicks on that trial, change this to <q>t</q> and we can now
                                            see clicks show up on our new image.</li>
                                        <li>Lastly, we have the file extension, if the image was jpg, leave it as <q>.jpg</q>, if it was png, change it to <q>.png</q>. Case matters.</li>
                                    </ol>

            <h1>Other Appearance Options</h1>
            The first half of this video also covers adding an image to the CT viewer, however the above tutorials
            are profoundly better. The last half covers changing colors/etc of the viewer itself.

                <li class="li2">Don't spend too much effort here. The viewer, and its loading bar, should be hidden while the user
                    reads consent / instructions, and fills out demographics info. If everything goes correctly, 
                    the viewer should be finished loading before it has a chance to be seen.</li>

                                <li>In this file, there is a section called <q>Loading Bar</q></li>
                                <li>There are five groups of values

                                        <li><q>&hellip;panel > &hellip; > img</q> is the format of the image.</li>
                                        <li><q>waitSpinner</q> is the spinner that appears when the user input blocks while
                                            the viewer loads as well as when the user's data is submitted.</li>

                            You can completely overwrite the loading screen by implementing two functions (check <q>scripts/viewerEvents.js</q> for skeleton code):
                            <ol>
                                <li><q>window.viewerCustomLoadingBar(panel)</q> is called when the loading bar is first created.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The parameter <q>panel</q> is the root panel to build everything inside of.</li>
                                        <li>If you do not create an element here with the id <q>viewer-meter-inner-bar</q> you must create the function mentioned below as well.
                                            Otherwise, the viewer tries to advance a loading bar which doesn't exist (and crashes the loader, so no ct viewer will appear ever).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><q>window.viewerLoadingBarAdvance(percent)</q> is called when the loading bar advances.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The parameter <q>percent</q> is a number between 0 and 1 indicating how much data is loaded.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
