    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="viewerStart.html">A working build of the viewer (obviously at this point it should be complete and ready to pilot)</a></li>
        <li>Somewhere to host it.</li>
        <li><i>May be optional</i> FTP client (<a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>You will learn:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a host</li>
        <li>Whether or not you should secure your site</li>
        <li>How to upload your experiment to your new host</li>
        <li>Tips on sharing your experiment</li>
    </ol>

    <br><br>
    Things to consider when choosing a host:
    <ul>
        <li>Consider whether or not you want a secure site
            <ul>
                <li>Links to secure sites are less likey to be considered spam, so extra care would have to be taken if emailing
                    links to your study (especially if you use a free subdomain).</li>
                <li>There is no free option for a secure host which uses php. However if you are using formspree
                    or something which allows for static webpages you may be able to use a popular web builder site
                    (however it would have to suport JavaScript).</li>
                <li>Hopefully your university provides you with webspace. Some don't, and they know who they are, and
                    you should definitely shame them for it. It's not the 90's.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
