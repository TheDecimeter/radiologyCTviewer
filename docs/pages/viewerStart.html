                        <li>Download and Unzip the CT viewer <a href="https://github.com/TheDecimeter/radiologyCTviewer/releases">release</a> somewhere.</li>
                        <li>Right click and open a terminal in that new folder's location (where there is a file called <q>index.html</q>)</li>
                        <li>Start the server with the terminal

                        </li>
                        <li>The terminal should now say <q>Development Server Started</q> or something similar</li>

                    Steps I took in <b>Windows 10</b>
                    <ol class="li2">
                        <li>Get a built version of PHP: <a href="https://windows.php.net/download#php-7.4">Go to their download page.</a></li>
                        <li>Choose the zip file (I chose the thread safe download, probably doesn't matter for our purposes)</li>
                        <li>Make a folder somewhere, we'll name it <q>testFolder</q>. I recommend placing this in the root of the C drive, you'll navigate to it later from the command line.</li>
                        <li>Place the newly downloaded zip in <q>testFolder</q> and extract it there.</li>
                        <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/TheDecimeter/radiologyCTviewer/releases">release</a>.</li>
                        <li>Place the newly downloaded release zip in <q>testFolder</q> and extract it there.</li>
                        <li>You should now have a <q>php.exe</q> file and a <q>build01</q> folder together (along with a mess of other files/folders</li>
                        <li>Open a terminal (you can type <q>cmd</q> into the search bar in your start menu).</li>
                        <li>Navigate in the terminal to your newly created folder.

                                <li>You will likely want to use <q>cd ../</q> until your prompt says you are in the root of the C drive.</li>
                                <li>Using <q>dir</q> should now show you the <q>testFolder</q> we created.</li>
                                <li>Use <q>cd testFolder</q> to enter the folder you created.</li>
                                <li>Using <q>dir</q> should now show you <q>php.exe</q> as well as <q>build01</q>.</li>

                                <li><q>cd <i>directory name</i></q> will take you to a new folder in your current directory.</li>
                                <li><q>cd ../</q> will take you to your parent directry (the direction of the slash doesn't matter).</li>

            This is not the server that will be running your program, you will want a remote webhost for that.
            The reason we are using this temporary server is because you will be making/testing many changes.
            It would take too long to upload small changes to your remote server for testing every time.
            <br><br>
            Remember you can always turn off the server by pressing ctrl+C in the terminal running the server.
