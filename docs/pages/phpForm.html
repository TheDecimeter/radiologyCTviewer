    This tutorial is optional if you are happy with a pure random distriubtion. Also, if you are using
    a server which doesn't allow server side code, and are instead relying on a third party form manager
    like <a href="https://formsubmit.co/">formsubmit</a>, these next two pages should be ignored and you should go straight to the publication
    clean up.
    <br><br><br><br>
    First, make sure you have:
    <ul class="li2">
        <li><a href="viewerStart.html">A working build of the viewer</a></li>
        <li>A text editor you like, preferably with syntax highlighting for HTML, JavaScript and PHP (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">The one used in the example</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    (as of June 2020)

    <br><br>
    <h2>You will learn:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How to alternate between page orders rather than using pure randomization.</li>
        <li>How to Make the experiment display a specific page order.</li>
    </ol>

    <br><br>
    Unlike previous tutorials, this one has 3 flavors:
    <ol class="li1">
        <li>Alternate your trial order based on how much data was saved
            <ul>
                <li>Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easiest to write</li>
                        <li>Doesn't rely on a single file which can only be used by one user at a time</li>
                        <li>If a user doesn't complete an experiment, it doesn't throw off the cycle</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forcing a specific order still effects the cycle</li>
                        <li>If multiple users start, they will all have the same order</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Good for experiments with a slow hit rate</li>
                <li><a href="edits/06a_distributeBySubmission.zip">The changed files for this step can be found here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Alternate your trial order based on a file saved at the beginning.
            <ul>
                <li>Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allows users to start before others finish without throwing off the cycle</li>
                        <li>Forcing a specific order doesn't effect the cycle</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A little harder to write because it relies on file reading/writing</li>
                        <li>If a user loads the page and drops out, the cycle is thrown off.</li>
                        <li>Relies on a central file which only one user can access at a time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Good for experiments where many participants start simultaneously, but few leave without completing the experiment.</li>
                <li><a href="edits/06b_distributeByCounter.zip">The changed files for this step can be found here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Alternate your trial order based on a file saved after a specific page.
            <ul>
                <li>Pros:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allows users to start before others finish without throwing off the cycle</li>
                        <li>Forcing a specific order doesn't effect the cycle</li>
                        <li>Users can leave before a certain point without throwing off the cycle.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Much harder to write because it relies on a third call to the server</li>
                        <li>Relies on a central file which only one user can access at a time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Good for experiments where many participants start simultaneously</li>
                <li><a href="edits/06c_distributeDelayCounter.zip">The changed files for this step can be found here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <br><br>
    Note:
    <ol>
        <li>The files will be slightly different from the tutorials (all versions can have a user ID and force shuffle)</li>
    </ol>
